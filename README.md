Concept: Visualizing and Interacting with Machine Learning Pipelines in Web

This project is an effort to make machine learning pipelines interactive to machine learning starters and non-technical users allowing them to visualize the undergoing processes in every step of machine learning pipeline.
From data cleaning to Data Visualization to applying machine learning algorithms and to come up with a acceptable model score, this application serves the purpose of overviewing and applying of limited machine learning algorithms to provided data.

It is a system that allows users to build, train, and predict with machine learning models directly from a web browser, with the ability to interact with the model in real-time.

Being the preliminary concept and with limited resources it involves in visualizing the training process and model performance, adjusting model hyperparameters, and providing input to the model through the web interface. The goal of an Interactive Machine Learning Pipeline is to make the process of building and deploying machine learning models more accessible and user-friendly, so that even non-technical users can benefit from the power of machine learning.
